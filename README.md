# COVID-19 in Prisons, as Told by Data
### Python (Plotly, Pandas, Streamlit)
#### Currently works better on Chrome. Not sure if this is related to Streamlit or source code (ported over from Heroku after they removed their free plan), may look into this in the future.

View the project [here](https://covid-prisons.herokuapp.com). Note: the Plotly charts are not responsive, so this works best on desktop.

I wanted to make this data project to explore the impact of COVID-19 in prisons versus the overall population.

Prison COVID-19 data from The Marshall Project, a nonprofit investigative newsroom dedicated to the U.S. criminal justice system. Check out their data repo [here](https://github.com/themarshallproject/COVID_prison_data).

COVID-19 data from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. Check out their data repo [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

This is my first-ever data project, so I'm open to suggestions, discussion, and / or feedback!
