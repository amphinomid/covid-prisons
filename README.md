# COVID-19 in Prisons, as Told by Data
### Python web app, built with Plotly, Pandas, and Streamlit and hosted on Heroku

View the project [here](https://covid-prisons.herokuapp.com). Note: the Plotly elements are not responsive, so this works best on desktop.

I wanted to make this data project to explore the impact of COVID-19 in prisons versus the overall population.

Prison COVID-19 data from The Marshall Project, a nonprofit investigative newsroom dedicated to the U.S. criminal justice system. Check out their data repo [here](https://github.com/themarshallproject/COVID_prison_data).

COVID-19 data from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. Check out their data repo [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

This is my first-ever data project / web app, so I'm open to suggestions, discussion, and / or feedback!
